            Well, my (real) name is <label className="myname">Carlos</label>,
            but you can call me <label className="myname">Aru</label> (ngl, I really like it!).
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a 21-year-old <label className="cs">Computer Science</label>{" "}
            student, and that's the reason why I'm really into everything about
            low-lever programming; I fell in love with how things work under the
            hood.
          </p>
          <p>
            My favorite language is <label className="rust">Rust</label>, and as
            you can imagine, that's the reason for that cute, tiny, eye-catching
            crab moving side to side at the top of the page. Although, I usually
            program in:
          </p>
          <section className="languages">
            {Object.values(CURRENT_LANGS).map(
              (lang) =>
                lang != "Rust" && (
                  <p key={lang} className={lang}>
                    {lang}
                  </p>
                ),
            )}
          </section>
          <p>Also, I'd like to learn:</p>
          <section className="languages">
            {Object.values(FUTURE_LANGS).map((lang) => (
              <p key={lang} className={lang}>
                {lang}

          <p>
            I have a confession to make: I know I've said that my fav lang is
            <label className="rust"> Rust</label>, but I've been programming using
            <label className="cpp"> C++</label> recently and I'm really getting into it! Idk, I just
            started learning the syntax and suddenly it became my <label className="main-lang">main lang</label>.

            <p>
              <label className="date">In November 2024</label> I decided to create an
              X/Twitter account with the main purpose of sharing my CS study sessions.
              I quickly found a friendly community called
              <label className="community"> "Study Buddy"</label> where lots of people
              share their personal <label className="notes">notes</label>,
              <label className="ssview"> study-session views</label>,
              <label className="setup"> setups</label>, and several other
              <label className="etc"> aesthetic things</label>.
            </p>

            <p>
              For instance, this is my usual view when <label className="personal-view">I'm studying at home</label>. It looks nice, doesn't it?

            One of the things I enjoy the most is solving logic problems. I'm
            sure you're familiar with platforms like{" "}
            <label className="leetcode">LeetCode</label> (my favorite btw ‚òùüèΩü§ì),{" "}

            <label className="codesignal">CodeSignal</label>,{" "}
            <label className="codeforces">CodeForces</label>, and so on. I spend
            around 2 hours a day solving these kinds of problems.

          <p>If you want to check out my profile, here's my LeetCode:</p>

            Yup, I've talked about my current studies, my favorite languages,
            and my obsession with LeetCode, but what do I do when I'm not
            programming? Do I play LoL like an average CS or SWE?

            I love <label className="gardering-label">gardening</label>. For a
            few months now, I've been growing various veggies in my garden. My
            dad grew up in a rural area, so he knows a lot about this wonderful
            world.

          <p>
            Actually ‚òùüèΩü§ì, that's the reason I developed a garden organizer,
